# Internship-Mnagement-System
It is an internship module done by me through Full Stack Web development course.
This software automates complete process of Internship at college starting from Apply Now to generating Nomination Letter. This also captures weekly progress and outcome of Internship. This application has been developed using HTML 5, CSS 3, BOOTSTRAP, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, PHP, AJAX and MySQL.
